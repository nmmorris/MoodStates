## Mood States
#### by Natalie Morris


### Overview

State machine indexes through an array of five png files using the number keys to demonstrate different moods.


### Modifying the Template

(1) Add your own PNG files in the assets folder. Make sure they match the names ***exactly*** of the existing PNGs.

(2) Add custom drawing code to drawOne(), drawTwo(), drawThree(), drawFour(), drawFive()

(3) You can add your own interfaces - keys, mouse events, etc in the Interfaces section

Don't change anything else!
